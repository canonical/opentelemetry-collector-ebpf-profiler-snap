## Install

    sudo snap install otel-ebpf-profiler --edge --classic

([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))



## Configuration

Once installed, a default configuration file will be created at `/etc/otel-ebpf-profiler/config.yaml`.

To write a configuration file to suit you needs, consult the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

## Testing

Before running the smoke test, make sure you have the following installed:

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview)
- [LXD](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/) 
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can run a smoke test to validate that your locally developed snap can be packed, deployed, and is running correctly:

```bash
just smoke
```
